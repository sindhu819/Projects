## Credit card Fraud detection


In this project, I worked on credit card fraud detection problem dealing with imbalanced data. The dataset for this project was obtained 
from [kaggle.com].

## Description of the dataset:

The dataset contains credit card transactions made in september 2013 by European holders. The dataset is said to be imbalanced because out 
of 284,807 transactions only 492 are fraudulent and remaining transactions are Non fraudulent. Overall it has 30 features and all of them 
are numeric. The features V1,V2,V3....V28, inorder to protect the confidentiality, the names and critical information about these features 
are not revealed. The Time features tells the time when the transaction took place. The amount feature reveals the Amount information of 
each transaction and the target variable Class, where 1 represents it is fraud and 0 otherwise.
